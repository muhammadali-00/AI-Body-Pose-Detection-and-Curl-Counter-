# AI-Body-Pose-Detection-and-Curl-Counter-
This project uses OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time pose estimation and exercise counting. It captures webcam video, tracks body landmarks, calculates joint angles, and counts arm movement repetitions. Ideal for tracking exercise form and performance in real-time using computer vision techniques
